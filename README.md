## General Information
- The is a regression model that predicts the count of bike rides based on multiple independent variables.
- Company want to identify the varaibles taht can predict the number of rides per day and identify variables that positively affects the total number of rinde.
- Dataset contains the day, kid of weather , events of the day temperature etc collected perday for year 2018 and 2019. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temp , weather condition, year , working day found to the the major factor which is influencing customer turnout. Model built was able to predict the counts with 80% confidence rate.
